// Floor generation for the daily dungeon.
// A floor is four WINGS, each a small cluster of three spaces joined by open doors. KURA starts in the first wing.
// Each wing but the last has two LOCKED doors out of it: an OFFER of two rooms. The six room kinds are dealt out
// over the floor's three offers, so every kind is offered once, and she opens one door of each offer (one key a day).
// The room behind a door is the first space of the next wing. A wing holds:
//   - a room (the one she unlocked, with its kind; the start room has none),
//   - a PASSAGE (no kind, no demons, little in it), and
//   - a DEAD END, which hides a big clue about one of the wing's two locked doors,
// plus sometimes a FALSE DOOR (it looks locked, but it is only paint). The last wing has no locked doors:
// the stairs down are hidden in its passage or its dead end.
// A wing is built the moment its door is unlocked, so nothing past the next offer exists yet.
// Everything is rolled from the floor's seed, so a floor can be rolled again from it.
// Shared by the web page and node, like screen.js.
