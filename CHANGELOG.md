# Changelog

Changes to the game itself, newest first. Save commits (`Day NNN ...`) are the adventure log and aren't listed here.

## v0.10 - Oct 6 2026

- New minimap symbols, one per room: `[@]` KURA, `[^]` the way up, `[v]` the stairs down once found, `[?]` the lure, `[ ]` a visited room. Doors are `=` between rooms side by side and `‖` between stacked rooms. The facing direction lives in the turn controls and FACE instead of the map.
- The saved game's map is redrawn in the new style.
- `[^]` (GO) into a wall now stops with a message like "KURA walks into solid stone." No day is spent, and KURA no longer spins to the next door.
- The end of the week is now deadly: if the stairs aren't taken by the 7th day on a floor, the next action ends the run. The party falls to 0 HP, the view goes dark, and only RST starts over. (This replaces the old placeholder that dropped KURA to the next floor.)
- The three log lines each have one job. Line 1 (moon and demons) changes once per real day. Line 2 describes KURA's latest action: moving, searching, turning, walking into a wall. Line 3 is flavor, with the occasional faint clue, and changes when a day passes.
- FACE on the bottom line is replaced by STEP, a count of every action KURA has taken: GO, SEARCH and turning (`STEP 012`). Bumping a wall doesn't count.

## v0.9 - Oct 6 2026

- Turn controls at the foot of the 3D view: `[^]` walks forward, `[<]` and `[>]` turn, and the letter between them shows which way KURA faces. Click them or use the arrow keys.
- Turning writes "KURA turns to face EAST." (free, no day spent), so direction words show up in actions as well as movement.
- The "[L]OAD returns to the saved game" note under the screen is gone.
- The first log line is now a mysterious word on the moon, the demons or both ("Demons drowse in the corners.", "The moon is a white eye, wide open."), with no phase number since the moon bar shows it. Five versions per phase, changing with each new day.

## v0.8 - Oct 6 2026

- The save status moved into the bottom border (`SAVED 2026-10-06` or a gold `NOT SAVED`), so all three log lines are free for the game.
- Log lines only name a direction when stating a character's action, such as "KURA goes WEST into a new room". Doors and hints never give a direction away; the map, the room view and FACE show where things are.
- Doors are only counted when KURA first searches a room ("A single door." / "Two doors.").
- Turning no longer writes a log line. After GO or SEARCH, the third line is atmosphere. About half the time it carries a faint clue about the room or the door KURA faces (a hollow floor, a cold draft, a glint), never a direction.
- The save status shows for a few seconds after loading or playing, then fades back into the border.
- The clock's colon blinks more slowly.

## v0.7 - Oct 6 2026

- The clock is live: the colon blinks every second and the time changes the moment the minute turns over.
- The minimap is centered on KURA: her room stays in the middle and the floor moves around her.
- The README links to the playable page.

## v0.6 - Oct 6 2026

- The game now plays on real floors. The minimap, the room view and the second log line all follow KURA.
- `[G]O` (or the up arrow) walks through the door KURA faces, or down the stairs once they're found. Facing a wall, GO turns to the next way out instead. The left and right arrows turn KURA. Turning is free.
- `SE[A]RCH` (or A) turns up the next hidden thing in the room: demons (damage and ICHOR), items, SILVER, the `?` or the stairs. A room with nothing left can't be searched.
- GO and SEARCH each use up a day. NEXT picks a day's action by itself, as a testing shortcut.
- If the week runs out without finding the stairs, the floor gives way and KURA falls to the next floor (a placeholder rule).
- RST starts a new run on a fresh B1F.
- MAG is now ICHOR.

## v0.5 - Oct 6 2026

- Floor generation in the new `floor.js`. Each floor is 3 rooms in a 3x3 grid, joined by doors in a line or an L. KURA starts in the up-stairs room.
- The stairs down are hidden in one of the other rooms. Every room hides 1-3 things (demons, items, SILVER, the stairs, sometimes the `?`), and searching turns them up one at a time. Walking straight to the stairs room and searching it always fits in the 7-day week.
- Most floors have a `?`: a shop, special room or rare item, shown in the dark until it's found.
- New minimap for floors: only rooms KURA has been in are drawn, as `[   ]`, with doors `╫` (side by side) and `═` (stacked). Floors aren't wired into NEXT or the save yet.
- MACCA is now SILVER.

## v0.4 - Oct 6 2026

- `[N]EXT`, `[L]OAD` and `[R]ST` buttons in the bottom border of the page. Click them or press N, L or R.
- NEXT rerolls a placeholder room (random map, room view, HP/MP, MACCA, MAG) and RST starts a new run. Both happen only in your browser and are never saved; a `NOT SAVED` note shows until you LOAD.
- LOAD reloads the saved game from GitHub.
- Random rolls live in the new `rules.js`.

## v0.3 - Oct 6 2026

- New fog-of-war minimap: visited rooms are `□`, unexplored rooms stay hidden, and a lone gold `?` waits in the dark (a lure, not the exit).
- Stairs: `⋰↑` up, `↓⋱` down.
- Text is soft white instead of green-tinted, KURA's arrow is pure white, and the screen is slightly bigger on computers.
- Map symbols are boxed to exactly one character so the right border stays straight in any font; plain characters like `?` and the arrow use the retro screen font.

## v0.2 - Oct 6 2026

- MACCA and MAG share one line; the party panel uses the full width.
- KURA is drawn on the minimap as an arrow showing the facing direction (`^ > v <`), and the bottom line reads `ALIGN [NEU]  FACE E  DAY 004`.
- The page refreshes once a minute and picks up new saves without reloading.

## v0.1 - Oct 6 2026

- First screen on the web: an 80-column Shin Megami Tensei-style dungeon screen drawn from `save.json`, with the live Honolulu date, time and moon phase.
- The same drawing code (`screen.js`) is used by the web page, the `/smt-screen` chat command and the morning screen.
