# Changelog

Changes to the game itself, newest first. Save commits (`Day NNN ...`) are the adventure log and aren't listed here.

## v0.6 - Oct 6 2026

- The game now plays on real floors. The minimap, the room view and the second log line all follow KURA.
- `[G]O` (or the up arrow) walks through the door KURA faces, or down the stairs once they're found. Facing a wall, GO turns to the next way out instead. The left and right arrows turn KURA. Turning is free.
- `SE[A]RCH` (or A) turns up the next hidden thing in the room: demons (damage and ICHOR), items, SILVER, the `?` or the stairs. A room with nothing left can't be searched.
- GO and SEARCH each use up a day. NEXT picks a day's action by itself, as a testing shortcut.
- If the week runs out without finding the stairs, the floor gives way and KURA falls to the next floor (a placeholder rule).
- RST starts a new run on a fresh B1F.
- MAG is now ICHOR.

## v0.5 - Oct 6 2026

- Floor generation in the new `floor.js`. Each floor is 3 rooms in a 3x3 grid, joined by doors in a line or an L. KURA starts in the up-stairs room.
- The stairs down are hidden in one of the other rooms. Every room hides 1-3 things (demons, items, SILVER, the stairs, sometimes the `?`), and searching turns them up one at a time. Walking straight to the stairs room and searching it always fits in the 7-day week.
- Most floors have a `?`: a shop, special room or rare item, shown in the dark until it's found.
- New minimap for floors: only rooms KURA has been in are drawn, as `[   ]`, with doors `╫` (side by side) and `═` (stacked). Floors aren't wired into NEXT or the save yet.
- MACCA is now SILVER.

## v0.4 - Oct 6 2026

- `[N]EXT`, `[L]OAD` and `[R]ST` buttons in the bottom border of the page. Click them or press N, L or R.
- NEXT rerolls a placeholder room (random map, room view, HP/MP, MACCA, MAG) and RST starts a new run. Both happen only in your browser and are never saved; a `NOT SAVED` note shows until you LOAD.
- LOAD reloads the saved game from GitHub.
- Random rolls live in the new `rules.js`.

## v0.3 - Oct 6 2026

- New fog-of-war minimap: visited rooms are `□`, unexplored rooms stay hidden, and a lone gold `?` waits in the dark (a lure, not the exit).
- Stairs: `⋰↑` up, `↓⋱` down.
- Text is soft white instead of green-tinted, KURA's arrow is pure white, and the screen is slightly bigger on computers.
- Map symbols are boxed to exactly one character so the right border stays straight in any font; plain characters like `?` and the arrow use the retro screen font.

## v0.2 - Oct 6 2026

- MACCA and MAG share one line; the party panel uses the full width.
- KURA is drawn on the minimap as an arrow showing the facing direction (`^ > v <`), and the bottom line reads `ALIGN [NEU]  FACE E  DAY 004`.
- The page refreshes once a minute and picks up new saves without reloading.

## v0.1 - Oct 6 2026

- First screen on the web: an 80-column Shin Megami Tensei-style dungeon screen drawn from `save.json`, with the live Honolulu date, time and moon phase.
- The same drawing code (`screen.js`) is used by the web page, the `/smt-screen` chat command and the morning screen.
